10 seconds

Everybody can create an account
Everybody plays at once
the game updates every 10 seconds
every 10 seconds something happpens
your stats change
your character gets more something
random thing happens every 10 secotnds
new match happens every 10 seconds

one round every 10 seconds
each player of 100s can play the 10 second thing

everybody does something in 10 seconds

there is a 5 minute period between rounds

timer in the corner that says how long till the next round
the gameplay will take place in the prep time where you make decisions
and in the 10 seconds where you see what happens

you have a saved state in the game that is updated during the 10 second matches


every account needs a ladder ranking

10 seconds are not real time

every time you play a round, it is as if you have played 10 more seconds
your total time count adds up
it is only added to your total when join a match, which you can do during the 5 minute prep sessions

a thing in life where
you have a group of stuff that is your pile
the pile of stuff determines how you perform in the thing you are doing
stuff happens at a fast pace in the thing you are doing

take a game that happens in real time and requires twitch reflexes
break that game down into 10 second intervals
make the game a rpg

1-2 minute turns - you select an action
then the game updates and 10 simulated seconds go by

if you are not there, your score doesn't change

paintball/laser tag

two people are having matches
two poeple are randomly assigned each other for a match based on their ladder ranking

you have 10 seconds worth of actions, you specify which things the person on your team does for 10 seconds

turning takes 1 second, moving takes 2 seconds, firing takes 1 second, idle
x steps = x steps / 2

paint ball / laser tag


what if there were 2 huge infinitely sized teams


you only control one player and can only see one screen's worth of tiles

you can only see in front of you 10 squares and 5 on either side

types of squares:
    grass - normal
    road - running takes one stamina instead of 2
    tree, rock, building - blocks view and impassable
    water - can't run, walking takes stamina, if you are stuck in water, you have to rest
    cornfield - can't see through, have to be next to someone to see them, can't run
    rocks
    roads

you can see the terrain but you can't see other people unless you can see them

each second happens for everyone at the same time

you can look in any of the 4 directions, 90 degree turn takes 1 second, 180 turn takes 2 seconds
walking takes 2 seconds per square

actions:
    walk = move 1 square, costs 1 second per square
    run = move 2 squares, costs 1 seconds per 2 squares, 2 stamina for 1 second of running

max 20 stamina
stamina is restored for every second you stand

stamina meter


during the resolve phase, the game is stepped 1 second at a time for 10 seconds, and everyones actions happen,
if an offensive player is on the same square as a defensive player, that player is captured, and sent to the jail/ back to their base, so there is no waiting on someone to rescue you


add chat between players on the same team

have chat messages that are seen after the 10 seconds are up

you also have a hearing radius and that determines who you can hear
you can type a message on every 2 minute turn, that you broadcast to everyone around you
friendly and enemy players can hear you

CTF in a large area
you are put on a team when you decide to start playing
you are put at your base
